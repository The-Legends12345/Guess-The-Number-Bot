# Privacy Policy — Guess The Number Bot

**Effective Date:** 17-09-2025

## 1. Introduction
GuessTheNumberBot ("the Bot") is a Discord entertainment bot created to provide a number-guessing game experience. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Bot collects, how that information is used, and how it is protected.

## 2. Data We Collect
The Bot only collects **minimal, non-sensitive information** strictly necessary to provide and maintain gameplay:

- **Discord User IDs** (to associate game sessions and scores)
- **Server IDs** (to identify which server the bot is operating in)
- **Game-related data** (e.g., guesses, scores, wins, attempts)

No other personal data is collected by the Bot.

## 3. No Sensitive Data
The Bot does **NOT** collect or store sensitive personal information, including (but not limited to):

- Email addresses  
- Passwords or authentication credentials  
- Payment or financial information  
- IP addresses  
- Chat message contents or private DMs

## 4. Purpose of Collection
Collected data is used only to:

- Provide and improve gameplay features  
- Maintain fairness and integrity (prevent cheating or abuse)  
- Operate bot commands and related functionality

The Bot does **not** use data for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.

## 5. Storage & Retention
- Most data is stored **temporarily in memory** during active game sessions and cleared when the session ends.  
- The Bot does not store long-term personal data unless a feature explicitly requires it (for example, an optional scoreboard). If long-term storage is used, it will be disclosed in this policy and kept to a minimum.

## 6. Data Sharing & Third Parties
- The Bot **does not sell, rent, or trade** user data.  
- The Bot may run on third-party hosting or use third-party services to operate; those services are subject to their own privacy policies.  
- Because the Bot operates on Discord, interactions are also subject to **Discord’s Privacy Policy**.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The Bot follows Discord’s minimum age requirement (usually 13+ or the applicable local age). The Bot does not knowingly collect data from children below the permitted age.

## 8. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. However, no online system can be guaranteed 100% secure. Use the Bot at your own discretion and avoid sharing sensitive personal information.

## 9. Your Rights & Data Removal
You may:

- Stop using the Bot at any time.  
- Request deletion of any stored data related to you.

To request data deletion or for privacy-related questions, contact the administrators via the official support server:

When requesting deletion, please provide your Discord ID and a brief description of what you want removed to help us locate the relevant data.

## 10. Policy Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The **Effective Date** at the top will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
